DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS EXAM PROJECT REPORT

1. Introduction
The advancement of technology has revolutionized the way educational institutions operate and manage data. With the growth of digital learning, research activities, and multi-disciplinary programs, there is a critical need for data structures and algorithms that can support dynamic and efficient academic operations. Universities, especially at the postgraduate level, require database systems that not only store student and course data securely but also provide fast retrieval, smooth interactions, and scalable architecture for future expansions.
This project titled “CyberspaceDB” was developed as part of the MDST 815: Data Structures and Algorithms course during the second semester of the Ph.D. program in Data Science and Technology at Nasarawa State University, Keffi, under the Centre for Cyberspace Studies (CCS).
CyberspaceDB is a lightweight yet powerful academic database management system built using Python and SQLite. It utilizes linear data structures such as lists and dictionaries to dynamically manage in-memory data before committing changes to the database. The system models a university's academic environment by managing data related to:
•	Students
•	Courses
•	Lecturers
•	Departmental structures
•	Enrollments
The design supports three core departments of the university's Cyberspace program:
•	Data Science
•	Computer Science
•	Cyber Security
Each department hosts its own students and lecturers, but they share access to a centralized pool of courses. This flexibility ensures that any student from any department can enroll in courses across all departments, supporting interdisciplinary study paths and collaborative learning environments.
CyberspaceDB was developed as a practical demonstration of applying data structures and algorithms in real-world database and software system development. The project highlights how theoretical knowledge can be applied to solve practical problems in educational technology and student information systems.
This report details the problem statement, system architecture, step-by-step implementation, and additional enhancements that increase the system’s usability and functionality.

2. Problem Statement
Due to the increasing number of students and courses offered across various departments, manual and fragmented management of academic records has become inefficient and error-prone. The primary objective of this project was to design a structured database system that allows easy storage, retrieval, enrollment tracking, and visualization of academic records. It also aimed to analyze the time complexities of fundamental operations to ensure that the system remains optimal and responsive under scale.

3. Description of the Project
The primary objective of this project was to design and implement a fully functional and efficient academic database system named CyberspaceDB, which caters to the needs of a university’s postgraduate academic framework. This system models the real-world operations of a university, focusing on its key academic components: students, courses, lecturers, and the enrollments that connect them.
CyberspaceDB was designed specifically for the Centre for Cyberspace Studies (CCS) at Nasarawa State University, Keffi, covering three major departments under the Ph.D. in Data Science and Technology program:
•	Data Science
•	Computer Science
•	Cyber Security
The database system manages and maintains structured records in the following key domains:
Core Functional Areas:
•	Students:
Stores detailed records of students including their names, assigned departments, and course enrollments.
•	Courses:
Maintains a unified pool of 20 courses. These are not department-exclusive, allowing for interdisciplinary learning, where students can register for courses outside their primary department.
•	Lecturers:
Contains the profiles of 10 lecturers, each linked to one of the departments. Lecturers may be responsible for teaching one or more courses.
•	Enrollments:
Models a many-to-many relationship between students and courses. Each student can register for 3–5 courses, and each course may have multiple students.

Technological Implementations:
To deliver a modern, interactive, and high-performing system, the project incorporates the following components:
1. Python + SQLite Backend:
The backend logic is written in Python, chosen for its simplicity, flexibility, and extensive support libraries. SQLite serves as the relational database management system, offering a lightweight and serverless storage solution ideal for application prototyping and deployment.
•	All data creation, insertion, and querying are executed through Python’s sqlite3 module.
•	Database schema includes tables such as Department, Students, Courses, Lecturers, and Enrollment, with primary and foreign key constraints for relational integrity.
2. Linear Data Structures:
To manage temporary in-memory data during execution and testing, linear data structures like lists and dictionaries were used. These data structures:
•	Hold student, lecturer, and course data before committing them to the database.
•	Enable efficient iteration and filtering operations before writing SQL queries.
3. Time Complexity Analysis:
To align with the course objectives in Data Structures and Algorithms, key operations in the project were analyzed based on their time complexity:
Operation	Description	Time Complexity
Insert	Adding a student, course, or lecturer	O(1)
Select	Fetching student or course by ID	O(1)
Join	Querying enrolled students or course names	O(n)
Full Scan	SELECT * from a large table	O(n)
This analysis helps assess the efficiency and scalability of the system, ensuring that it performs well as data grows.
The CyberspaceDB project effectively integrates database management, software engineering, and algorithmic thinking. It provides a practical solution to managing a university’s academic data while also serving as an academic exercise in applying data structures for optimized performance. Through a combination of a relational backend, algorithmic rigor, and user-facing interfaces, the project exemplifies the real-world application of concepts taught in the MDST 815 course.

Step-by-Step Implementation
The development of the CyberspaceDB system followed a structured approach, beginning with conceptual modeling and progressing through schema creation, data population, and programmatic integration. Below are the key implementation steps:

Conceptual Design
The project began with the creation of an Entity-Relationship (ER) model, which visually defines the relationships among the main entities in the database. This model laid the groundwork for the relational schema and ensured proper planning of how data would be stored and accessed.
ER Diagram Key Relationships:
•	One-to-Many (1:M)
Each Department can have many Students and many Lecturers.
This reflects the academic structure where multiple individuals belong to one department.
•	Many-to-Many (M:N)
Each Student can enroll in multiple Courses, and each Course can have multiple Students.
This relationship is implemented through an Enrollment table, which acts as a bridge table.
•	One-to-Many (1:M)
Each Lecturer is linked to a specific department but can be associated with multiple courses for teaching purposes (in future enhancements).
The ER model provided clarity in translating real-world academic processes into relational constructs.

Database Schema Creation
Once the ER model was established, we implemented it in SQLite by defining five core relational tables. These were created using Python's sqlite3 library:
Defined Tables and Their Purpose:
•	Department(Dept_ID, Name)
Stores the list of departments (Data Science, Computer Science, Cyber Security).
Dept_ID serves as the Primary Key.
•	Students(Student_ID, Name, Dept_ID)
Holds student information and the department they belong to.
Student_ID is the Primary Key, while Dept_ID is a Foreign Key referencing the Department table.
•	Courses(Course_ID, Course_Name, Credits)
Stores course data offered across all departments.
Course_ID is the Primary Key.
•	Lecturers(Lecturer_ID, Name, Dept_ID)
Contains lecturer details linked to a department.
Lecturer_ID is the Primary Key; Dept_ID is a Foreign Key referencing the Department table.
•	Enrollment(Student_ID, Course_ID)
Represents the many-to-many relationship between students and courses.
A composite primary key (Student_ID, Course_ID) was used to prevent duplicate enrollments.
Key Features of the Schema:
•	Referential integrity is maintained using foreign key constraints.
•	The design is normalized to avoid redundancy and ensure clean data storage.

Data Population
With the schema in place, the next step was populating the tables with realistic data to simulate a functioning academic system. The Python random module was used to generate and assign data programmatically.
Population Strategy:
•	Departments:
The three departments were inserted manually into the Department table.
•	Students:
50 students per department, totaling 150 students, were generated with random names and automatically linked to their department via Dept_ID.
•	Lecturers:
10 lecturers were created with randomly generated names and assigned to departments in a round-robin or random distribution.
•	Courses:
20 interdisciplinary courses were created. These are not department-specific and are accessible to students from any department, promoting cross-departmental learning.
•	Enrollments:
Each student was randomly assigned between 3 and 5 courses, ensuring diverse course selections.
Enrollments were inserted into the Enrollment table, creating a realistic simulation of student-course registration patterns.
This automated approach ensured that the system could scale efficiently and mirror the variability seen in real-world academic environments.
Query Implementation and Time Complexity
With the database populated, a variety of SQL queries were implemented to demonstrate real-world data access patterns and to evaluate the system's efficiency using algorithmic principles. These queries were executed via Python using the sqlite3 module, and their time complexities were analyzed to assess the performance of the system.
Key Queries Implemented:
1.	Retrieve All Students
SELECT * FROM Students;
Use case: Display all registered students.
Time Complexity: O(n) — because all rows in the table are scanned.
2.	Retrieve Students by Department Name (Join)
SELECT Students.Student_ID, Students.Name, Department.Name
FROM Students
INNER JOIN Department ON Students.Dept_ID = Department.Dept_ID
WHERE Department.Name = 'Data Science';
Use case: Filter students from the Data Science department.
Time Complexity: O(n) — with an efficient join, assuming indexes are used.
3.	Retrieve Courses Taken by a Specific Student
SELECT Courses.Course_Name
FROM Enrollment
JOIN Courses ON Enrollment.Course_ID = Courses.Course_ID
WHERE Enrollment.Student_ID = ?;
Use case: List the courses that a student is enrolled in.
Time Complexity: O(k), where k is the number of enrolled courses for that student.
4.	Enroll a Student in a Course
INSERT INTO Enrollment (Student_ID, Course_ID) VALUES (?, ?);
Use case: Enroll a student in a new course.
Time Complexity: O(1) — a single insert operation.
5.	List Courses with Number of Enrolled Students
SELECT Courses.Course_Name, COUNT(Enrollment.Student_ID) AS Total_Students
FROM Courses
LEFT JOIN Enrollment ON Courses.Course_ID = Enrollment.Course_ID
GROUP BY Courses.Course_ID;
Use case: Visualize course popularity.
Time Complexity: O(n + m), where n is the number of enrollments and m is the number of courses.
Summary of Time Complexities:
Operation	Time Complexity	Notes
Insert a student/course/lecturer	O(1)	Constant-time insertion
Select all records from a table	O(n)	Linear with table size
Search by primary key (e.g., Student_ID)	O(1)	Primary keys are indexed
Join operations	O(n) or O(n log n)	Depends on indexing and join strategy
Aggregation with GROUP BY	O(n)	Proportional to number of records
By analyzing the time complexities, we ensured that the system remains scalable and efficient, even as the data grows significantly.

Summary
The CyberspaceDB project represents a comprehensive and practical implementation of a student information management system designed to support academic operations at the postgraduate level. The system was built using Python and SQLite, underpinned by linear data structures like lists and dictionaries, and serves as a real-world application of concepts from the MDST 815 course on Data Structures and Algorithms.
